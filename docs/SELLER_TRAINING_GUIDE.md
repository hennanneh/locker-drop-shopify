### What is LockerDrop?

LockerDrop is a shipping option that lets customers pick up their orders from Harbor smart lockers. Instead of traditional home delivery:

- **Customers** choose a convenient locker location at checkout

- **Customers** pick up when it's convenient for them using their own code

### Benefits for Your Business

- **No missed deliveries** - Customers pick up when they want
- **Reduced shipping costs** - Often cheaper than last-mile delivery
- **Faster fulfillment** - Drop off locally, no waiting for carriers
- **Happy customers** - Flexible pickup on their schedule

## Product Configuration

### Why Configure Products?

Different products need different locker sizes. A t-shirt fits in a small locker, but a large box needs an X-Large locker. Setting this up ensures customers only see lockers that can fit their order.

### Setting Product Sizes

1. Go to **Product Settings** tab
2. Select a product from the dropdown
3. Choose the **Maximum Locker Size** needed
4. Optionally enter exact dimensions

### Size Guidelines

| Locker Size | Good For |
|-------------|----------|
| Small | Jewelry, accessories, small clothing |
| Medium | Most clothing, shoes, small boxes |
| Large | Large clothing, multiple items, bigger boxes |
| X-Large | Bulk orders, large items, oversized boxes |

### Best Practices

- Always round UP - if in doubt, choose a larger size
- Consider packaging - add space for bubble wrap, boxes, etc.
- Test occasionally - order from yourself to verify fit
