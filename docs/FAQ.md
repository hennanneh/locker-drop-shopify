## General Questions

### What is LockerDrop?

LockerDrop is a Shopify app that adds smart locker pickup as a shipping option. Customers can choose to pick up their orders from secure Harbor Locker locations instead of home delivery.

### How does it work?

1. Customer selects "LockerDrop Pickup" at checkout
2. A locker is **reserved immediately** when they complete payment
3. You receive the order with a drop-off link
4. You drop the package at the assigned locker using your phone
5. Customer gets notified automatically and picks up using their link

### What are Harbor Lockers?

Harbor Lockers are secure, automated pickup lockers located in convenient public locations like apartment buildings, retail stores, and office complexes. Each locker has a touchscreen where users enter access codes to open compartments.

### Is LockerDrop free for customers?

That depends on your settings! You can configure LockerDrop to be:
- **Free** (most common) - as a delivery alternative
- **Discounted** - cheaper than home delivery
- **Standard rate** - same as other shipping options

### What happens if lockers are full?

If no lockers of the required size are available, checkout will **not allow** the customer to select LockerDrop. This prevents situations where an order is placed but no locker can be assigned. The customer will need to choose regular shipping or wait until lockers become available.

### Can lockers get "oversold"?

No! Unlike some systems that just check availability, LockerDrop actually **reserves the locker during checkout** before the customer pays. This guarantees a locker is available for every LockerDrop order.

### Can I use LockerDrop for all my products?

Most products work great! Consider:
- **Size** - Must fit in largest locker (24" x 20" x 16")

- **Fragility** - Lockers are safe for most items

Products that may NOT work:
- Oversized items (furniture, large equipment)
- Temperature-sensitive items (unless using special lockers)
- Extremely heavy items

### How much does LockerDrop cost me?

LockerDrop is free to install. You only pay a small per-order fee ($1-$2) each time a customer uses locker pickup at checkout. No monthly subscription, no setup fees. You only pay when you're making sales.

### Can I use multiple locker locations?

Yes! In the "My Lockers" tab, you can select any Harbor Locker locations you want to use. Most sellers choose 3-10 locations that are convenient for them and their customers.

### How do I check real-time locker availability?

Go to the **Availability** tab in your dashboard. You'll see:
- Each enabled locker location
- Available lockers by size (small, medium, large)
- Total capacity and current usage
- Last updated timestamp

Click "Refresh" to get the latest availability from Harbor Lockers.
